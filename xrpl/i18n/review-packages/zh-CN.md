# XRPL LAYMAN review package: 中文（简体）

This file is for a native speaker of 中文（简体）. You do not need the website source code, and you do not need to open the site. The English sentence and the current 中文（简体） translation are both in this file. The CSV next to this file has the same rows.

Nothing in this package is native-approved. The Approve, Correction, Reviewer, and Date lines are blank on purpose.

## How to review

1. Read one row at a time. The sections follow this order: wallet recovery and seed, signing, destination tags, trust lines, reserves and fees, DEX and AMM, NFTs, then other security and finance copy.
2. A sentence is filed under the first matching section. Seed wins over every later topic. A destination-tag sentence is in the destination-tag section even if it also mentions signing.
3. Decide whether a reader of 中文（简体） learns the same fact as the English, including every “not”, “never”, and “cannot”. A quiz answer that is false in English must stay false.
4. Do not change `$XRP`, the numbers `1` and `0.2`, account addresses, `NFTokenID`, `NFTokenPage`, `TakerGets`, or `TakerPays`.
5. Terms in the glossary stay in English. A parenthetical gloss such as `(trust line)` or `(seed)` may stay next to the translated term.
6. If the translation is right, write `approve` on the Approve line. If it should change, leave Approve blank and write the full replacement on the Correction line.
7. Write your name and the date yourself. Do not mark a row approved for someone else.

## Glossary of terms kept in English

## 1. Wallet recovery and seed

This sentence is about the secret that can recreate the account.

What the reader must understand for this whole section: A seed or secret is not a resettable password. Anyone who has it can control the account. Changing an app password does not fix a leaked seed.

- Purpose: This sentence is about the secret that can recreate the account.
- What the reader must understand: A seed or secret is not a resettable password. Anyone who has it can control the account. Changing an app password does not fix a leaked seed. The English wording to preserve is: A signer list assigns weights and a quorum. For example, three independent signers of weight one with quorum two requires enough valid signatures to reach two. This only protects the intended signing route: review any enabled master or regular key as well. Test recovery on a non-production network before moving authority.
- English: A signer list assigns weights and a quorum. For example, three independent signers of weight one with quorum two requires enough valid signatures to reach two. This only protects the intended signing route: review any enabled master or regular key as well. Test recovery on a non-production network before moving authority.
- Current translation: 签名者列表（signer list）设置各签名者的权重和签名权重门槛（quorum）。例如，三位独立签名者的权重各为 1，门槛为 2，就需要有效签名的权重合计达到 2。这只保护预期的那条签名途径：也要检查任何已启用的主密钥（master key）或常规密钥（regular key）。在转移权限之前，先在非生产网络上测试恢复。

- Purpose: This sentence is about the secret that can recreate the account.
- What the reader must understand: A seed or secret is not a resettable password. Anyone who has it can control the account. Changing an app password does not fix a leaked seed. The English wording to preserve is: A Xaman payload is a signing request. Your product should first explain the action, network, signing account, exact asset, recipient and amount or permissions. A sign-in identifies an account; it is not a payment. Never ask users to paste a seed, secret numbers or a private key into your page.

A sign-in identifies an account; it is not a payment. Never ask users to paste a seed, secret numbers or a private key into your page.
- Current translation: Xaman 载荷（payload）是一条签名请求。你的产品应当先说明这一动作、网络、签名账户、确切资产、接收方，以及金额或权限。SignIn 用来识别一个账户；它不是一笔支付。绝不要让用户把种子（seed）、秘密数字或私钥粘贴到你的页面上。

What the reader must understand for this whole section: A signature authorizes the exact transaction the signer approved. A sign-in is not a payment, and the wrong signer, key, or quorum does not become valid because the interface looked finished.

A signed request can still fail or remain unresolved on ledger.

A sign-in is not a payment, and the wrong signer, key, or quorum does not become valid because the interface looked finished. The English wording to preserve is: List the issuer, operational accounts, enabled master signing, regular key and signer list. A regular key can authorize most account actions; it is not merely a read-only API credential. Disabling master signing does not prove that all other signing routes are gone.

- What the reader must understand: A trust line creates the holding relationship for an issued token. It is not an endorsement, not proof the token is safe, and not a promise the issuer will redeem it. The English wording to preserve is: TrustSet creates or modifies a trust-line relationship. Its LimitAmount identifies the currency, the counterparty issuer and the limit. Native XRP does not use trust lines. This lesson covers trust-line tokens, not MPT authorization.

What the reader must understand for this whole section: Keep the English warning. Freeze is not destruction. A blackhole is not proof a project is safe. MPTs are a different standard from trust-line tokens. A false quiz answer must stay false.
