# XRPL LAYMAN review package: Español

This file is for a native speaker of Español. You do not need the website source code, and you do not need to open the site. The English sentence and the current Español translation are both in this file. The CSV next to this file has the same rows.

Nothing in this package is native-approved. The Approve, Correction, Reviewer, and Date lines are blank on purpose.

## How to review

1. Read one row at a time. The sections follow this order: wallet recovery and seed, signing, destination tags, trust lines, reserves and fees, DEX and AMM, NFTs, then other security and finance copy.
2. A sentence is filed under the first matching section. Seed wins over every later topic. A destination-tag sentence is in the destination-tag section even if it also mentions signing.
3. Decide whether a reader of Español learns the same fact as the English, including every “not”, “never”, and “cannot”. A quiz answer that is false in English must stay false.
4. Do not change `$XRP`, the numbers `1` and `0.2`, account addresses, `NFTokenID`, `NFTokenPage`, `TakerGets`, or `TakerPays`.
5. Terms in the glossary stay in English. A parenthetical gloss such as `(trust line)` or `(seed)` may stay next to the translated term.
6. If the translation is right, write `approve` on the Approve line. If it should change, leave Approve blank and write the full replacement on the Correction line.
7. Write your name and the date yourself. Do not mark a row approved for someone else.

## 1. Wallet recovery and seed

This sentence is about the secret that can recreate the account.

What the reader must understand for this whole section: A seed or secret is not a resettable password. Anyone who has it can control the account. Changing an app password does not fix a leaked seed.

Do not assume every NFT’s metadata pointer is fixed.
- English: NFTokenMint sets important flags. Transferable allows transfers between ordinary holders; without it, issuer-related transfers have special restrictions. Burnable gives the issuer or its authorized party burn authority; owners can burn their own NFTs. A mutable NFT can have its URI updated by the issuer or authorized minter through NFTokenModify. Do not assume every NFT’s metadata pointer is fixed.
- Current translation: NFTokenMint fija flags importantes. Transferable permite transferencias entre tenedores comunes; sin eso, las transferencias ligadas al emisor tienen restricciones especiales. Burnable le da al emisor o a su parte autorizada autoridad de quema; los propietarios pueden quemar sus propios NFT. Un NFT mutable puede tener su URI actualizada por el emisor o por el acuñador autorizado mediante NFTokenModify. No supongas que el puntero de metadatos de cada NFT está fijo.
